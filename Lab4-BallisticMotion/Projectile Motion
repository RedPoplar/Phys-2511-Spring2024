print("Observations: The first thing that stood out to me, was the trend of Creature's mentsions. Creature is the most steadily relevant throughout the whole book, for the most part. However, Creature is almost never the most relevant character. This is interesting, as Creature is arguably the main subject of the story. Secondly, Victor is mentioned surprisingly little throughout the text. This is interesting, as he is the character for which the story is named after. The third interesting trend would be the large spikes in mentions. This could be indicitive of back-and-forth dialogue.  ")
